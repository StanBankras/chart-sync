# Chart Sync

Chart sync helps traders work on their ideas together in real-time. Traders can create rooms where they can generate an invite link for others to join.

## Concept & Sketches
A lot of traders in the cryptocurrency space are sharing their trade ideas, and there are a lot of big crypto groups discussing ideas. Chart Sync will allow these traders to work on the same canvas to come to ideas and new insights together.
